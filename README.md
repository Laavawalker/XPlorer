# XPlorer
### A new advanced file explorer.
Will have many functions, for example notepad, simple image editor. This app is still in development, so expect it to be not working. Many functions still not released.
## New in 0.3
### Added simple commands runnable in the file path input, like:
-  `new`**:** opens a popup to make a new file or folder, as if you'd open it from File>New...
-  `about`**:** opens a popup about the app, as if you'd open it from Help>About
-  `exit`**:** closes the app
-  `newpatch`**:** opens the What's new window, as if you'd open it from Help>What's new?
-  `home`**:** redirects to homescreen, which is a "**welcome**" screen
-  `settings` or `options`**:** a place where you will have the basic options of the app, but there is a huge problem with this one, so I've decided to disable this for the nearest time and take care of other things

>The homescreen now shows every time you launch the app.
Settings are comming soon, this update was made for a "milestone", to revert changes I'd make, if these would make the app unusable.
